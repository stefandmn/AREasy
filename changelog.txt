01. Environment: Build new distribution using 8.1 ARSystem libraries

2.1
======
27. Environment: Testing environment has been designed and implemented as general Ant targets and specific property file that
	will includes test parametrization. The testing environment is fully functional on both Unix/Linux and Windows and could
	be used in case of ANT_HOME, AREASY_HOME and JAVA_HOME are defined.
26. Unix/Linux installer has been update to recognize the configuration already set in the previous installation. All these
	configuration values will be provided as default values during installation process. Also the installer is able to update
	user profile variables
25. Environment: Deployment (local and remote) procedures have been improved and now the configuration management targets are
	able to deploy complete or partial runtime components over SSH. In order to be able to do this you have to set your Ant
	environment, deploying libs/tools/jsch*.jar library (in case of Ant is call through a development tool try to configure the
	classpath of that tool to know about the location of jsch*.jar library)
24. Environment: Ant targets have been improved to  be able to create WIndows installer even if the target is run from
	Linux/Unix. This is possible in case of the host has WINE installed and Z: drive is the root. Also you have to have NSIS
	installed over WINE.
23. Preserve data type during communication between client and server when the input parameters contain functions.
	The builtin functions are: int(), long(), float(), double(), decimal(), date(), bool(), file()
22. Implement soft interruption mechanism in RuntimeAction and it was applied to main action from core and aar packages.
21. It has been added two additional options to select target CI when the 'data.cmdb.remove.relationship.ci' and
	'data.cmdb.create.relationship.ci' actions; it's about cirelationdatasetid and cirelationclassid that allows you to isolate
	the target-ul CI.
20. Update 'data.cmdb.create.relationship.ci' action to support specific type of relationships and also to have possibility to
	set relationship impact.
19. Two new actions have been added to register and remove user functional roles: admin.set.application.role,
	admin.remove.application.role
18. The  actions that register and remove ITSM application permissions have been renamed to: admin.set.application.permission,
	admin.remove.application.permission
17. Package action has been improved to support reconfiguration of 'default.properties' sector and to deploy resources
	in /bin folder
16. Add Windows binary to launch areasy command line
15. Windows and Unix installers have been improved regarding Service registration options
14. Add support for x64 platform, for registration of Windows service.
13. Unix/Linux installer has been created as a self extractor archive and a shell script that is configuring the environment
	and the runtime instance.
12. Periodic runner from thread manager has been replaced with a veritable cron engine. Also thread manager has been updated
	to simplify statuses and calling operations.
11. Add a new functionality to initiate and store persistent objects, shared between actions.
10. Package action has been updated to accept many library repositories that are appended to the main repositories managed
	in the default.properties configuration sector.
09. Windows installer has been improved to register AREASY_HOME/bin location in the PATH variable and to support re-install
	actions.
08. Designed and implemented a methodology to work with plugins and modules. Because of this purpose has been created a new
	system action called 'package' that can install a new AREasy package (ARJ file). The installation procedure includes
	deployment of configuration resources that will be merged/appended to the existing configuration, libraries that will be
	loaded in the classpath without to restart the server.
07. Add in Windows installer all necessary options for basic configuration: AREasy server name and port, AR System server name
	and port, AR System credentials and windows service option.
06. Transform "reload" action into "config" action having an extra-scope to set configuration keys from configuration sectors.
05. Add rich help texts to several administrative actions
04. Add rich help texts for all system actions.
03. Communication protocol has been changed to accept partial answer flushed during action execution and caught by the client
   without to close the communication pipe
02. Rich help mechanism. Documentation about each action is provided into a text file read and displayed by help action or -help
   option attached to each action that has the help text file.
01. Project reorganization. SNT.AREeasy project has been segregated in many sub-projects - one for API and runtime application and
   each old module became a separate project.

2.0
======
14. Action "data.wrapper.file" has been improved to allow data limit control and also to transfer parameters to sub-actions.
13. Change communication protocol to accept an unlimited number of transferred file between server and client. The
	enhanced protocol is not applicable for runtime execution mode.
12. Add a dedicated process for Windows service option. 
11. Windows installer and uninstaller has been designed.
10. Startup scrips have been redesigned.
09. Definition manipulation actions have been update to support 7.6.03/04 mechanism regarding overlay objects.
08. Data actions have been improved to accept string qualification criteria
07. Parser engine has been reorganized and extend it to support additional data-sources
06. Add in transaction string qualification criteria
05. Remove RPC option from user connection
04. Optimize CoreItem structure for simplified and complex calls using 7.5/7.6 API
03. Compatibility to 7.5/7.6 API and release JNI and native calls and interoperability.
02. Startup system action renamed to Start.
01. Shutdown system class action became Stop.

1.2
======
05. Added RunProcessAction as a system action, allowing to execute external processes.
04. Transform "data.fnd" actions into "ars.admin" actions and update them to support extended parametrization.
03. Extend number of input and output file (transferable file) to an unlimited number.
02. Redesign communication protocol between client and server.
01. Transform "file" and "input-file" in inputfile parameter (which can be transferable from the client to server) and also
	transform "output-file" in "outputfile" parameter (which is also transferable frpom server to client).

1.1
======
04. Update RuntimeServer module to support execution of scheduled jobs not immediate after they are instantiated and
to be started after wating time. For this scenario must be used configuration "app.server.startup.<jobname>.now=false".
By default this option is true.
03. Implement data file option for actions data.entry.add, data.entry.update, and data.entry.remove. These actions
could use data from a specified file and will repeat the core action behavior for each record.
02. Fix building & configuration procedure
01. Implement and add "data.entry.add" and "data.entry.update" action to be able to submit data and update
entries in any ARS schema.

1.0
======
01. Initial version inherited from java.Remedy.AREasy project, based on reorganizing and refactoring.
