<h1>AREasy Runtime &amp; API</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>AREasy is a powerful (runtime)
tool and API used to manipulate workflow objects and data, managed by
one or more BMC Remedy
AR Server instance. This application could be used directly in Remedy
workflows (via a dedicated FILTERAPI plugin) or like a client-server or
standalone utility, having possibility to extract or update data or to
deploy or export workflows.
Additionally, using the runtime engine and API you can create your own
actions which could be integrated and executed to deliver content and
signals to the workflow objects.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="documentation-Architecture.png" align="middle" border="1" height="368" width="600"></p>

<p>The main goal is to deliver
standard operations (called <strong>actions</strong>)
that could be executed from command line or using Remedy workflow
objects&nbsp;to manage server workflows (data and definitions), to
maintain foundation data for ITSM suite and CMDB data (CIs and related
details) and to perform common administrative&nbsp;activities
related with BMC Remedy AR System server. AREasy Runtime is coming
with a simplified Java API to create standard ARS plugins and with a
complete set of out-of-the-box plugins: general FILTER API plugin which
can be used for any general purpose, and AREA plugin which can replace
actual C AREA plugin, having capabilities to configure and
design authentication workflow based on your needs. Beside on these
"abstract" plugins, AREasy delivers (into a separate&nbsp;module)
two specialized AREA plugins, for LDAP authentication and for
single-sign-on (for more details see <em>areasy-sso</em>
module documentation).</p>

<p>Depending by your needs AREasy&nbsp;could run in three modes:</p>

<ul>

<li>server - starts the runtime
execution, and opens a TCP socket to listen commands (actions) which should to be
executed. This server mode could be started manually using scripting command or
via Remedy FILTERAPI when the AR System server is started is triggered a specific event. </li>
<li>client - execute a dedicated action (already registered in the runtime mapping)
calling the runtime server which could be located on a remote server and specifying the
right command line. </li>
<li>standalone (or runtime mode) - starts the runtime and execute a specific action
(already registered in the configuration), deliver the output and then runtime will stop
the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tipically the application is used as a <b><u>central bus for integrations</u></b>,
for third party systems and applications which should exchange data with AR System server.
AREasy has possibility to communicate with the ARS servers in a synchrony
mode (based on FILTERAPI module) but also in an asynchron mode (running
binary client from the workflow as a normal process or outside of ARS
workflows). For example, if you will try extract data from an excel
file during an workflow execution and to save data you should
run the runtime client implemented in FILTERAPI - to receive a
synchronized answer with your workflow, to bring data in real time and
then to&nbsp;save and process it. This parsing action action is
already implemented and distributed with&nbsp;the runtime, and,
speaking for&nbsp;this scenario, you should
only implement an additional filter object which should call the
FILTERAPI
option (specifying&nbsp;<b>AREASY</b>
string value for the FILTERAPI name) into a <code>Set
Field</code>
action, defining the
input command and mapping the form field which should receive the
answers (the parsed values). So, AREasy could help you to interrogate
and integrate other applications and datasource with minimum effort,
reducing dramatically the time for integration implementation.</p>

<p> One of
main&nbsp;advantages of&nbsp;using AREasy
in&nbsp;server&nbsp;mode is that the actions implemented and
deployed in the runtime container, could be called using <b><u>impersonation</u></b>
mechanism, avoiding unmanaged transactions or other system constraints
(like licensing policies,&nbsp;transactions with the same user from
multiple hosts, etc.).&nbsp;If you want
to execute a user workflow and one of the steps&nbsp;cannot be
implemented with
ARS objects and definitions, (e.g. if you want to manage some external
data inside of your workflow execution session - that means that the
current user should keep his console open but in
the same time, the same user should be connected on the external
service
to collect different data and to bring it in the workflow) AREasy
will manage all these ARS external actions, working with a different
user
session but impersonated by the&nbsp;current&nbsp;user.</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Runtime</h2>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">runtime</span> is the main part of
<b>AREasy</b>
application, having capability to assume input parameters and to parse
them, to compose runtime syntax to call different actions. The actions
are already implemented Java classes (having a&nbsp;special coding
format) which are registered in the runtime configuration
files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the runtime is called will
be created an instance of Runtime Manager component (see the API) which
could be one of these three options described before: <code>server</code>, <code>client</code>
or <code>standalone</code>. To differentiate these modes you should start the runtime&nbsp;specifying
parameter <code>-mode</code>
with one of those values: <i>server</i>
or <i>client</i>.
To start in standalone mode it's enough to ignore this parameter.
Another way to call a different type of runtime is to execute a
specific binary (from <var>$AREASY_HOME/bin</var> folder) which can do only one of these running modes:
<code> areasy.sh</code> - is the client mode, <code>server.sh</code>
is the server mode, etc.&nbsp; If
you want to start the runtime in server mode, all the other parameters
will be ignored. If you
want to execute an action (so to start the runtime in&nbsp;client
mode or standalone) you need to
specify all necessary parameters to define a complete command, and the
most import is to specify the action name which can be pointed out
using <code style="font-weight: bold;">-action</code> parameter name.</p>

<p>In case you need help to see
how the command line looks like you need to execute&nbsp;<code>help</code> action.&nbsp;
(<cite>areasy -action help -command &lt;command name&gt;</cite>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>To stop the runtime server (a runtime instance started in server mode) you must use
a special action called <code>shutdown</code> or <code>stop</code>
which should be called in the client mode from the same host where
server instance was started. If you want to execute shutdown action
remotely you need to specify the connectivity and credentials
parameters (see below the standard list of parameters).</p>

<p>When you are starting runtime
manager in the client mode you can use two optional parameters to
specify the server host and the TCP/IP port for connectivity to the
runtime server. So, in this scenario the runtime server is running on a
specific manchine and the runtime client is called from another machine
(e.g. your workstation).</p>

<table border="1">

<tbody>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%"><b>-host</b></td>
<td width="80%">Runtime
server name. If is ignored the server name will be the <code>localhost</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%"><b>-port</b></td>
<td width="80%">Port
number to connect to the runtime server. If is omitted the port number
will be taken from configuration file, reading property <code>app.server.port</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>To start the runtime in the
standalone or client mode always you must call an action, specifying
parameter <code>-action</code>
and then a value indicating the action name registered in the runtime configuration sectors.
This configuration is stored in <strong>properties</strong> files
(the main file is <code>cfg/default.properties</code>)
and the action name is given by&nbsp;<code>app.runtime.actions</code> properties.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Runtime Actions</h3>

<p>The application is comming with
a special set of already implemented actions to manipulate data and
workflow objects from a AR System server or from ITSM applications. To
start the execution of an action which should be connected to the AR
System server you must use the following comon parameterization:</p>

<table border="1">

<tbody>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%"><b>-arserver</b></td>
<td width="80%">Server
name - required login parameter that specifies the server to log in to.
If the parameter is not specified will be considered <code>localhost</code>
server name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%"><b>-aruser</b></td>
<td width="80%">Required
login parameter that identifies the user account</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%">-arpassword</td>
<td width="80%">Optional
login parameter that identifies the user account. Omit the option if
the user account has no password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%">-arport</td>
<td width="80%">TCP
port number used to log in when the portmapper is turned off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%">-arrpc</td>
<td width="80%">RPC
identifier when the portmapper is turned on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap" width="20%">-impersonate</td>
<td width="80%">This
parameter could override the runtime configuration (because by default
is working using impersonation) and will specify that actual user
connection and session will be performed using a general (and maybe
admin) user but impersonated for specified user in parameter <code>-aruser</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
