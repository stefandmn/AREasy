	<name>Remove System License</name>
	<description><![CDATA[
The action is part of AR System management tools and it has the main goal to remove the write or floating license for one or many users.
Actually this action will replace the existing license with a Read license. The login ids are validated before to be processed.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action admin.remove.system.license -method <people|user>] [-login <val>] [-logins <val1> <val2> ... <valn>] [-fieldid <CTM:People field id> [-fieldvalue <CTM:People field value>]]

Where:
	-method           = this option tells where to remove the license: in User form or (in case of ITSM applications are installed), in CTM:People form (foundation layer). "People" is considered default option. If "People" search option is selected the specified license removed from both places: User form and also CTM:People form.

	-login            = Remedy user id

	-logins           = list of Remedy user ids

	-userfieldid      = a specific field Id from CTM:People or from User form (depends by chosen search method) or other form in case of 'userformname' option is specified, to the create a qualification criteria to identify the login ids where this permission have to the applied

	-userfieldvalue   = the corresponding value for -fieldid option to compose the qualification criteria: <CTM:People fieldid> = <fieldvalue>. From the found people records will be extracted login ids that will be appended to the specified list through -login(s) option

	-userqualifiation = this could be the third option to take the list of persons and to provide them additional permissions / roles and licenses. Actually this option provide a way to select persons using a qualification criteria addressed to the direct connected AR System server.

	-userformname     = in case of 'userqualifiation' is used you can say a value for this option to find the usernames into an independent Remedy form (also you have to use 'userfieldid' to specify the field id that will be read from that form) or don't specify it and will search directly in People form and will read 'Remedy Login ID' field, or in User form and will read 'User Name' field (according to the 'method' option value)


Note: This action allows you to remove the license type for many users, from one action execution. You can combine this action with 'data.wrapper.file' and instead of real values for and -login option you'll refer a column from an Excel file or from a text file.

Attention: In order to execute this action you must have configured in the default configuration sector the Remedy server and all related details or you can specify them in the command line, using general options. For more details check the help manual from help action.
