	<name>Set Application Permission</name>
	<description><![CDATA[
The action is part of AR System management tools and it has the main goal to set a specific application permission and the corresponding license type to one or many users.
Application permission ans also login Ids are validated before to be processed.

The standard command line is described below:
areasy -action setapppermission -permission

<application permission>] [-license <fixed|floating>] [-login <val>] [-logins <val1> <val2> ... <valn>] [-fieldid <CTM:People field id> [-fieldvalue <CTM:People field value>]]

Where:
	-permission       = application permission (or permission name)

	-login            = Remedy user id

	-logins           = list of Remedy user ids

	-license          = license type applicable to the specified ITSM permission by -permission option. The license could be: Write, Floating, Read, Not Applicable or None. If this option is not specified the action will consider "None" license type as default for the specified permission.

	-userfieldid      = a specific field Id from CTM:People form (or other form in case of 'userformname' option is specified) to the create a qualification criteria to identify the login ids where this permission have to the applied

	-userfieldvalue   = the corresponding value for -fieldid option to compose the qualification criteria: <CTM:People fieldid> = <fieldvalue>. From the found people records will be extracted login ids that will be appended to the specified list through -login(s) option

	-userqualifiation = this could be the third option to take the list of persons and to provide them additional permissions and licenses. Actually this option provide a way to select persons using a qualification criteria addressed to the direct connected AR System server.

	-userformname     = in case of 'userqualifiation' is used you can say a value for this option to find the usernames into an independent Remedy form (also you have to use 'userfieldid' to specify the field id that will be read from that form) or don't specify it and will search directly in People form and will read 'Remedy Login ID' field

	-forceupdate      = update user permission (in case if is found in the system); license type will be overwritter

Note: This action allows you to set the same application permission and the same license type to many users, from one action execution. You can combine this action with 'data.wrapper.file' and instead of real values for -permission, -license and -login options you'll refer columns from an Excel file or from a text file.

Attention: In order to execute this action you must have configured in the default configuration sector the Remedy server and all related details or you can specify them in the command line, using general options. For more details check the help manual from help action.
