	<description>
Config action is used to set the configuration properties from configuration files and to reload server or runtime configuration entries. Config action runs in security mode that means could be called locally as it is or remotely, if you'll provide admin credentials (user credentials used to connect to the AR System instance).
Instead of clear text password could be also provided the obfuscated version. As is described in the second example, _Demo_ user and _1234_ password must be the values of `app.server.default.arsystem.user.name` and `app.server.default.arsystem.user.password` from `default.properties` configuration sector.
