/**
 * Defines a functor interface implemented by classes that transform one
 * object into another.
 * <p/>
 * A <code>Transformer</code> converts the input object to the output object.
 * The input object should be left unchanged.
 * Transformers are typically used for type conversions, or extracting data
 * from an object.
 * <p/>
 * Standard implementations of common transformers are provided by
 * {@link org.areasy.common.data.TransformerUtility}. These include method invokation, returning a constant,
 * cloning and returning the string value.
