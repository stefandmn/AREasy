	 * Collect this node and its child nodes (if-applicable) into the collectionList parameter, provided the node
	 * satisfies the filtering criteria.<P>
	 * <p/>
	 * This mechanism allows powerful filtering code to be written very easily,
	 * without bothering about collection of embedded tags separately.
	 * e.g. when we try to get all the links on a page, it is not possible to
	 * get it at the top-level, as many tags (like form tags), can contain
	 * links embedded in them. We could get the links out by checking if the
	 * current node is a {@link org.areasy.common.parser.html.engine.tags.CompositeTag}, and going through its children.
	 * So this method provides a convenient way to do this.<P>
	 * <p/>
	 * Using collectInto(), programs get a lot shorter. Now, the code to
	 * extract all links from a page would look like:
	 * <pre>
	 * NodeList collectionList = new NodeList();
	 * NodeFilter filter = new TagNameFilter ("A");
	 * for (NodeIterator e = parser.elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();)
	 *      e.nextNode().collectInto(collectionList, filter);
	 * </pre>
	 * Thus, collectionList will hold all the link nodes, irrespective of how
	 * deep the links are embedded.<P>
	 * <p/>
	 * Another way to accomplish the same objective is:
	 * <pre>
	 * NodeList collectionList = new NodeList();
	 * NodeFilter filter = new TagClassFilter (LinkTag.class);
	 * for (NodeIterator e = parser.elements(); e.hasMoreNodes();)
	 *      e.nextNode().collectInto(collectionList, filter);
	 * </pre>
	 * This is slightly less specific because the LinkTag class may be
	 * registered for more than one node name, e.g. &lt;LINK&gt; tags too.
