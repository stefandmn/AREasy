/**
 * The encoding is changed invalidating already scanned characters.
 * When the encoding is changed, as for example when encountering a &lt;META&gt;
 * tag that includes a charset directive in the content attribute that
 * disagrees with the encoding specified by the HTTP header (or the default
 * encoding if none), the parser retraces the bytes it has interpreted so far
 * comparing the characters produced under the new encoding. If the new
 * characters differ from those it has already yielded to the application, it
 * throws this exception to indicate that processing should be restarted under
 * the new encoding.
 * This exception is the object thrown so that applications may distinguish
 * between an encoding change, which may be successfully cured by restarting
 * the parse from the beginning, from more serious errors.
