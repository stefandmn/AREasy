/**
 * Describes an object that knows about ordering.
 * Implementors must have a comparison function,
 * which imposes a partial ordering on some
 * collection of objects. Ordered objects can be passed to a
 * sort method (such as org.areasy.common.parser.document.html.engine.util.sort.Sort) to allow precise control
 * over the sort order.
 * <p/>
 * An set of elements S is partially ordered
 * if and only if <code>e1.compare(e2)==0</code> implies that
 * <code>e1.equals(e2)</code> for every e1 and e2 in S.
 * <p/>
 * This all goes away in JDK 1.2.
 * <p/>
 * For use with java.lang.Comparable from JDK 1.2:
 * <pre>
 * public int compare (Object o1, Object o2)
 * {
 *     return (((Ordered)o1).compare (o2));
 * }
 * </pre>
